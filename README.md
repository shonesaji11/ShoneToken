# ShoneToken
Creating an ERC-20 Token which is deployed on the Ropsten test network

### Buying tokens
* Make sure Metamask is installed and an account on Ropsten test network is present.
* Go to https://shonesaji11.github.io/ShoneToken/
* Connect metamask wallet having ropsten address to the website. First time users may need to connect the wallet to the website manually.
  * Metamask provides the web3 instance, so without the connection the DApp will not work.
* Ensure the address has enough ETH. If not, visit https://faucet.metamask.io/
* Enter the amount of tokens to buy.
* Depending on number of transactions on the blockchain, there may be a slight delay (~1 min). Upon receiving the token, the page automatically refreshes
and displays the available SToken balance associated with the address. To view more details about the transaction visit https://ropsten.etherscan.io and search your address.

### Suggestions and Feedback
I am still learning how to build DApps on Ethereum and any suggestion / feedback to improve the project is highly appreciated.
